# Real-Time Bank Locker Access Authentication System

In an era where digital security is paramount, particularly in sensitive areas like bank locker access, traditional authentication methods prove insufficient in both security and user convenience. To address these challenges, we present the Real-Time Bank Locker Access Authentication System based on Facial Recognition Technology. Our innovative system utilizes facial recognition algorithms to seamlessly and securely grant access to bank lockers by analyzing unique facial features in real-time, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized entry.

## Key Features
- **Facial Recognition Authentication**: Utilizes facial recognition to accurately identify known faces in real-time.
- **Streamlined Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface, eliminating the need for PINs or access cards.
- **Enhanced Security**: Reduces vulnerabilities associated with traditional authentication methods such as PINs and access cards.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the "encoder generator" and then `main.py` file to start the Real-Time Bank Locker Access Authentication System.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge the developers of the facial recognition libraries and Firebase for their contributions to this project.
